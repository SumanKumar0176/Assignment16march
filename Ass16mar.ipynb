    "Q2: How can we reduce overfitting? Explain in brief.\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "some techniques to reduce overfitting in machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "i.Regularization: Regularization is a technique that adds a penalty term to the loss function during model\n",
    " training to discourage overfitting. The penalty term is a function of the model's parameters, and its value\n",
    " increases as the parameters become larger. Regularization techniques include L1, L2, and Elastic Net regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii.Dropout: Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out some of the neurons in the model during \n",
    "training. This technique helps to prevent the model from relying too heavily on any particular set of features,\n",
    " leading to a more robust and generalizable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii.Early stopping: Early stopping is a technique that stops the training process once the model's performance\n",
    " on the validation set starts to degrade. This technique helps to prevent the model from overfitting to the\n",
    " training data and leads to better generalization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv.Data augmentation: Data augmentation is a technique that artificially increases the size of the training \n",
    "set by applying transformations such as rotation, cropping, or flipping to the existing images. This technique\n",
    " helps the model to generalize better by exposing it to a wider range of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "v.Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique that evaluates the model's performance on multiple splits \n",
    "of the training data. This technique helps to assess the model's generalization performance and to identify\n",
    " overfitting issues."

    "other, the model is performing well. If the training error is much lower than the testing error, the model is overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii.Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique for assessing the model's performance by splitting the data into\n",
    " multiple folds and training the model on different subsets of the data. If the model performs well on all the folds,\n",
    " it is a sign that it is not overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv.Regularization: Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. \n",
    "If the model performs better with a regularization term, it is an indication that it was overfitting without it.\n",
    "\n",
    "v.Visual inspection: Finally, you can also visually inspect the model's predictions to detect overfitting and underfitting.\n",
    " If the model's predictions are too close to the training data and do not capture the underlying patterns in the data, it \n",
